 # HOW TO USE 
             
             1. Create an instance of any of the class you want to use 
                    e.g        var tree = new BinarySearchTree
              
              2.  Now you can call the containing methods of the class with the variable you created
                      e.g   tree.insert(100)
                            tree.root
                  
                N.B   Always use console.log to view the output
